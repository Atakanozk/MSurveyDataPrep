# MSurveyDataPrep
Hi everyone, 
This project is based on anonymous municipality survey data in Turkey. The municipality did a survey to learn their citizens’ satisfaction levels on 2 different areas. By doing that survey they also asked them 5 different questions about 5 different criteria. 
Survey’s questions are as follows:
• What is the most important issue for our municipality to work on in the future? 
• What is your biggest expectation from our municipality? 
• What is the biggest issue you have experienced in our municipality? 
• What is the greatest opportunity that the municipality should take into consideration? 
• How do you rate the working style of our municipality? (1 to 5) 
• In which field should we improve ourselves? 
• What makes you happy in this region? 
• How would you rate the communication between citizens and municipality? (1 to 5)
   Before doing ML and DL models, I had to clean and prepare the data. 
   I used R to for data preprocessing and cleaning. In those two files you can find my coding. 
   I’m still trying the improve them and I will publish my ml models in the next few days.
   Because of the confidentiality issues I couldn’t post the data.
